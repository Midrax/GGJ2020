# Sparky and Smith: Under Repair - Global Game Jam 2020
A co-op arcade-puzzler for the Air Console platform with no written language. The game features two abandoned robots, Sparky and Smith, who need to repair their way to freedom through a destroyed factory by constructing items to repair bridges and electronic doors. 

The controller and actions are unique for each player, one representing Sparky, an electrical specialist, and the other represents Smith, a mechanical specialist. The players must collect a box from the collection vent, then inspect the contents to learn what repairs the item will need. 

These tasks will be displayed on the top right of the screen with representative icons for the required task such as; soldering, electronic repair, programming, smithing, or smelting. Some tasks can only be done by a specific robot. To escape each room Sparky and Smith must work together to repair the items in a specific order and within a time limit.
